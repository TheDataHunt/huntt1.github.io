Below are images created using GeoDa. GeoDa is a free spatial analysis and autocorrection software you can download for free [here](http://geodacenter.github.io/download.html).
These images are based on the NUMPOINTS variable which is a count of violent crimes in each of the hexagons created over baltimore. This select dataset was created in the previous ["Project 2"](https://huntt1.github.io/Project2_BaltMap/Project2.html). You might notice that the grid of Baltimore has much larger hexagons than in Project 2. It was resampled to be more visible.

Below is a graph showing the Moran's I of the Baltimore crime dataset. This is a measure of how related or random the data set is. A Moran's I of 1 would be an extremely clustered dataset. A Moran's I of -1 would be if the points were perfectly dispersed. A Moran's I of 0 is a random placement of the data. As you can see below, the Moran's I of Baltimore Violent Crime Data is fairly high at 0.637.

The below two images show the signifigance and cluster maps for this baltimore crime data file. The general theme is what you would expect, the more populous downtown area has higher clusters of crimes and are highly significant. The one out of place high-high area is along route 129 and 140 leaving the city in the northwest.

Then you're like wait what else can i do with this data
