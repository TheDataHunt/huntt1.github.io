title: Final Proposal 

---

For the final project I have used the same dataset I modified for Project 2 earlier. This data was altered from the original set give by the Baltimore Police Department which is found here [Baltimore Police Crime Data](https://www.baltimorepolice.org/crime-stats/open-data). In this project i built on some previous ideas and incorporated some feedback i was given during my presentation. For my hexagon grid map that i had in project 2, i resampled tbe grid area to make it larger hexagons and more easily viewable. I then imported this data into GeoDa to do a cluster and statistical analysis on. This analysis will include a Moran's I for the baltimore city crime data. Afterwords I might include a 3d map with high crime areas as high elevation on the 3D map.

Essentially, for the final project i am looking at how crime clusters in Baltimore city. After this we will try to figure out why there are certain clusters of high crime in certain sections of the city that seem like outliers to the focus of crime on populated downtown Baltimore.
