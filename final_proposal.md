Final Proposal 


For the final project I have used the same dataset I modified for Project 2 earlier. this data was altered from the original set give by the Baltimore Police Department. In this project i built on some previous ideas and incorporated some feedback i was given during my presentation. For my hexagon grid map that i had in project 2, i resampled tbe grid area to make it larger hexagons and more easily viewable.. I then imported this data into GeoDa to do a cluster snd statistical analysis on. 




To get a C:

What are you going to do for the final project?
What is your question?
Where is the data coming from? Provide links? If you don't have - or can't find - the data, pick a different project.
What three non-superficial elements from the class are you going to incorporate? Python? SQL? Moran's I? 3D mapping? Hexagonal analysis? Analysis in GeoDa? Something else? (Non-superficial meaning doing more than importing the data with python.)
How will you know when you've answered your question?
To get an B, you'll need to create a new section of your markdown that will explain:

What other component from the class will you incorporate?
Why is more involved than the labs?
Why did you choose this component?
To get an A and secure an A in the course, you'll need to create a new section of your markdown that will explain:

Go above and beyond and trying something new - explain what it is that you learned on your own here.
